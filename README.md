# MAKING DA BLEEPS IN DA BROWSER

I never played with webaudio, and I'm theorycrafting a digital version of the Subharmonicon. Seems like a good time to play with browser synthesis.

there's a todo in the main js file. Here's another more long term one:

- make a prettier GUI for the actual similar to MOOG one
- make a list of improvements (more seperation of sounds and potentials for harmonics, longer sequencer etc)
- implement the new changes into the GUI
- fucken iterate
